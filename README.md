# Magic-8-Ball
**Intro to programming: Magic 8-Ball game (CodeCademy project):**

The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.

This is a simple Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

*Magic 8-Ball, should I do this project?*

This little program will be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball (plus 3 others that you will have to discover by yourself!):

- Yes - definitely
- It is decidedly so
- Without a doubt
- Reply hazy, try again
- Ask again later
- Better not tell you now
- My sources say no
- Outlook not so good
- Very doubtful

The output of the program will have the following format:

`[Name] asks: [Question] Magic 8-Ball’s answer: [Answer]`

For example:
<br>
Joe asks: *Is this real life?*
<br>
Magic 8-Ball's answer: *Better not tell you now*

Let’s get started!
